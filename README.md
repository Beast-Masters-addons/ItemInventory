# ItemInventory
Store characters item inventory and display it in tooltip on other characters.

The same functionality is provided by other addons like [BagBrother](https://github.com/Jaliborc/BagBrother) or Altoholic, but BagBrother requires BagNon and Altoholic does not support WoW classic.
This addon does not require any other UI-mods.

The inventory handling is done by [LibInventory](https://github.com/Beast-Masters-addons/LibInventory) which must be installed as a separate addon.

### TODO:
